# Usage

res.csv is generated by running gen.py, which can be modified to change the initially shipped simple rng 0-10 with 7 decimal digits that can be used for encryption or seed based randomization. Feel free to modify the generator any way you wish, it is just meant to automate the creation of your input src for plotgen.py

plotgen.py will create graphs according to your specification within plotgen.py, and res.csv (input).

## Purpose

plotgen is a combination of python programs to easily plot randomly, pseudo-randomly, or explicitly set values onto graphs over a period of time, or actions performed. 

The initial Proof of Concept was used to show how humanized automation techniques can be easily spotted when graphed over varying periods of time, and how this differs when obfuscated using random number generation based humanization. (Industry application: Anticheat, Antiscrape, Antibotting)
